============

Don't waste time with syntax; unleash the code!

### About
After learning the concepts behind programming, learning a new language comes down to one thing: syntax. The goal of tl;dr{code} is to be a central hub for programming syntax, allowing developers to focus more on the code itself.

### Get Involved
We need people like you to keep this site accurate and up-to-date. If you would like to contribute to the project by adding new languages or correcting existing ones, please send us a pull request on github. Program long and prosper!
