============

Don't waste time with syntax; unleash the code!

### About
After learning the concepts behind programming, learning a new language comes
down to one thing: syntax. The goal of tl;dr{code} is to be a central hub for
programming syntax, allowing developers to focus more on the code itself.

### Get Involved
